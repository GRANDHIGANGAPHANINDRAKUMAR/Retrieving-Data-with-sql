## Covid_Data_Analysis : 

## Problem Statement

Analyze COVID-19 data stored in a SQL database, containing information such as location, confirmed cases, active cases, population, deaths, and region. Utilize SQL queries to extract insights like total cases vs deaths, active cases, and recovery cases for each location. Explore metrics such as death rate, active cases rate, and recovery rate per population, offering a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact. Identify countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population, analyze regional trends in infection, recovery, and mortality rates, providing valuable insights for public health management and policy-making.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1: Connect to the SQL database containing COVID-19 data using SQL client tools like MySQL Workbench or pgAdmin.

- Step 2: Familiarize yourself with the structure of the dataset, including table names and column names (e.g., Location, Confirmed_cases, Active_cases, Population, Deaths, Region).
- Step 3: Write SQL queries to extract necessary data for analysis, such as total cases vs deaths, active cases, and recovery cases for each location.
- Step 4: Calculate additional metrics like death rate, active cases rate, and recovery rate per population using SQL expressions.
- Step 5: Identify countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population by querying and aggregating data.
- Step 6: Analyze regional trends in infection, recovery, and mortality rates by grouping data by region and calculating relevant metrics.
